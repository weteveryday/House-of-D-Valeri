# House-of-D-Valeri
DND Campaign Pack

This DND capmaing pack is a free open-source package to play House of D'Valeri campaign--a homebrew campaign that is somehow distant from a normal DND playstyle but pulls great amount of ideas, mechanics, and inspiration from DND.

I'll be providing a Wiki link of some sort for the players.

Most of the contents on this campaign is done with the help of AI tool such as OpenAI and Fotor AI.
