#The Tragedy of Casa de D’Valeri
LOCATION:
Casa de D’Valeri, nestled in the mist-heavy hills of Montivell, a remote, near-forgotten province in northern Europe. It is an isolated, three-story gothic estate wrapped in blackened ivy, looming towers, and silent gardens choked with weeds. The house is alive with creaks, moans, and the scent of rotting wood. Once a mansion of elegance and prestige, it now stands like a tomb—cold, empty, and cursed.

#THE FAMILY D’VALERI
Though wealthy and once influential, the D’Valeri name now lingers only in hushed whispers and yellowed newspapers. All five residents are dead, and the cause—a mystery so vile and twisted that even seasoned investigators have refused to step foot within Casa de D’Valeri again.
